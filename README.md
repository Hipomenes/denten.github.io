This repository contains the source code for my personal website and portfolio built in plain text and markdown on top of the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) Ruby framework and hosted on GitHub Pages.

The theme is a fork of [Hyde](http://andhyde.com/), which is itself a based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com) (incidentally, made by Mark Otto who is also respobsible for Twitter Bootstrap).

The artwork is by [Timothy Reynolds](http://www.turnislefthome.com/). Many design ideas were inspired by the work of [toin0u](https://github.com/toin0u) from [sbin.dk](http://sbin.dk), by [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com/blog/web-development/advanced-jekyll-features/), and [Keith Morran](http://www.marran.com/tech/category-pagination-in-jekyll/).
