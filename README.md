This repository contains the source code for my personal website and portfolio.

This is a static site, driven by plain text, markdown and the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) framework. I use GitHub Pages for hosting.

The theme is a fork of [Hyde](http://andhyde.com/), which is itself a based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler (incidentally, made by Mark Otto who is also respobsible for Twitter Bootstrap).

The artwork is by [Timothy Reynolds](http://www.turnislefthome.com/). Many design ideas were borrowed from <sbin.dk> by [toin0u](https://github.com/toin0u).
