bio:
- short: I write and teach in the fields of new media and digital humanities at Columbia University. My research often happens at the intersection of texts, people, and technology.
  long: My work engages the social, legal, and institutional structures that regulate the formation of knowledge and literary practice. A former software engineer at Microsoft and currently a faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, I am currently working to complete my first book manuscript on algorithmic imagination and have begun work on my second project on suggestion engines.
