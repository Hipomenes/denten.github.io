An [interesting report](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/11/19/losing-humanity-0) written by the Human Rights Watch relevant to my [Beyond the Human](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWElPChwL5P5K6xqDjNhdVBRCimroFecKo1xlupGCoo/edit) course.

"This 50-page report outlines concerns about these fully autonomous weapons, which would inherently lack human qualities that provide legal and non-legal checks on the killing of civilians. In addition, the obstacles to holding anyone accountable for harm caused by the weapons would weaken the lawâ€™s power to deter future violations."
