Dear Book Publishers,

Please stop making me pay twice for your products. My library spans hundreds of volumes, many in duplicate for classroom use. I don't see why I should pay full price for the digital versions. Let me pay a small upgrade fee for an online copy, or better yet, offer a subscription service to your catalog.  See http://oreilly.com/ for details.  With best regards,

Dennis
