Friday, April 5 â€“ Sunday, April 7, 2013
Farnsworth Pavilion, Rice Student Center

In this workshop we will build on the fundamentals of network analysis and graph theory to explore a data set of social interactions on a popular book piracy forum. Participants will learn to use Gephi--an open-access platform for visualizing and exploring networks and complex systems. Topics covered will include the data cycle, exploratory data analysis, network metrics, clustering algorithms, and elements of visual design.
