[piracylab.org](http://piracylab.org) is an academic research collective exploring the impact of piracy on global literary culture.

Our work combines critical, historical, and quantitative approaches to the study of illicit knowledge, information "leaks," and underground archives. We are interested in understanding the ethics and the social dynamics of piracy in its legal, technological, and socioeconomic contexts.
