I am very excited for my first year of teaching at Columbia. Besides the two courses in the Literature Humanities Core Curriculum, I have proposed the following two seminars: [Beyond the Human](http://d3nten.com/2012/04/beyond-the-human-2/) for the fall semester, and [Hacking the Archive: The Digital Humanities Toolkit](http://d3nten.com/2012/04/hacking-the-archive-the-digital-humanities-toolkit/) for the spring (with [Matt Connelly](http://history.columbia.edu/fac-bios/Connelly/faculty.html)).
