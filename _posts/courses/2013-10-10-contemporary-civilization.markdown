[My take](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JmDoYukSw7tggpVJrhaYFK_x_2bpPy2IA0dSSGHEbo/edit?usp=sharing) on Columbia's Contemporary Civilization core requirement. What a journey: reading Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Seneca with a group of students who [already covered](http://d3nten.com/2012/12/literature-humanities/) the lit canon from Homer to Woolf.

“Founded in 1919 as a course on War and Peace Issues, the central purpose of Contemporary Civilization is to introduce students to a range of issues concerning the kinds of communities – political, social, moral, and religious – that human beings construct for themselves and the values that inform and define such communities; the course is intended to prepare students to become active and informed citizens. While readings in this one-year course change from time to time, the factors that lead to adoption of a text always include historical influence, the presentation of ideas of enduring importance, and the demonstrated ability of a text to provoke productive discussion.”
