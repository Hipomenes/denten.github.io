In [this class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uKQyvgPtmW7J3w1shoQuEiJ8fHNfQFke0vukPkeW8aQ/edit?usp=sharing) we will explore the critical concepts behind the study of new media: information, code, metadata, message, algorithm, protocol, network, and platform. Seminal readings in the history of science, media theory, and philosophy of technology will supplement the applied research component of the course. In the studio component of the course, students will be expected to undertake an “excavation” project of their own, “unearthing” obsolete media and associated practices.

Open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates (by permission of the instructor).
