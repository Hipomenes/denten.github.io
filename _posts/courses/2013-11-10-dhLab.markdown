Every year the Digital Humanities Lab convenes to advance research in computational culture studies understood both as the study of computational culture and as computational approaches to the study of culture and society. In addition to traditional reading, discussion, and writing components of the class, participants are expected to work on a semester-long data-driven lab-based research project. Students and scholars from any field, at any stage of their academic or professional career, and at all levels of technical and critical proficiency are welcome to attend.

The course was designed with two goals in mind: first, to expand our shared methodological toolkit (aka, learn to code), and second, to examine the critical literature on a selected topic related to texts, information technology, and online communities.

The theme for the spring of 2014 is illicit knowledge. In working with several large datasets related to information piracy we will explore the ethics of stealing and sharing, the history and the future of censorship, the infrastructure and the social dynamics of underground library archives, laws protecting and punishing whistleblowers, the difference between remix and plagiarism, copyright regimes and free culture.

A provisinal syllabus can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaGiFBG_WSEGKFey9sR0pafjjKK7Fuc0jhF5d4K1ouA/edit).
