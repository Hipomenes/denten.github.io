I've joined a few friends from the Berkman Center and beyond in a venture called [Iron Blogger](http://iron-blogger.mako.cc/). The idea is to incentivize weekly blog contributions, or rather to dis-incentivize non-contribution: I already owe ten dollars for not posting anything in the last two weeks.

<!-- more -->
I am also thinking of following Peter Sauber's [example](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109377556796183035206/posts) by moving my posting activity to Google+ or Facebook. It makes sense to write from within your social network, although the loss of an independent platform does worry me a bit.
