**When?** Thursday, Feb 21 4-6pm
**Where?** Slavic Languages and Literatures, Columbia University

What are the digital humanities and why should you care? In this informal conversation we will talk about changes precipitated by technology in the disciplines of literary and cultural studies: about theory, methods, applications, ongoing projects at Columbia, and the job market. We will conclude by discussing the often unexamined connections to the Russian and the East European intellectual traditions, and the acute need for culturally-specific work in this rapidly developing field.
