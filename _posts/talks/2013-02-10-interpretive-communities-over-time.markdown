Big Data and Digital Scholarship Seminar

**When?** 6 pm Monday, February 11  2013
**Where?** Faculty House, Columbia University 

**Abstract**
The concept of an interpretive community is an argument for social constructivism: the idea which holds that meaning is contingent on its context. Using some rudimentary network analysis tools, this talk examines evidentiary standards in several discrete knowledge domains to find evidence both in support of and in disagreement with the prevailing theory. The preliminary results also tell us something interesting about the deeply-rooted tension implicit in big-data scholarship--a persistent thread in many of the seminar's discussions and one that is particularly relevant to research in the humanities and the social sciences.
