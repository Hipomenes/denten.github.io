An abstract for a paper I am submitting this week:

"From IBM's Watson to Apple's Siri we are urged to speak to machines as if they were people, and increasingly, expect them to respond in natural language. But what does it mean to play Jeopardy versus a computer or to ask a phone for directions? To what extent are "playing" and "asking" here are metaphors for modes of ideation divergent from our own? To begin answering such questions I reconstruct a string of thought experiments that lie at the foundation of modern computer science and further examine the resultant intellectual history in the context of a specific discursive encounter between human and computer."
