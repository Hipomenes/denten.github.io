From Data to Solutions seminar at [IGERT](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/igert/index.shtml) (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship).

The talk will introduce the audience to the emerging discipline of digital humanities, discuss its problems and premises, and finally outline several local projects aimed at transforming the institutions that shape our teaching and research.
