Wordpress showed me the power of content management. It was a truly exciting idea. Instead of ungainly static HTML, we would write content flows, creating websites that are more than the sum of its pages. Wordpress allowes you to channel conent into appropriate categories and unto the right pages. You can easily imagine running a large newspaper with Wordpress: custom fields drive forms, where every po 

custom fields, tailored for specific content types like Politics, Sports, or Classifieds. submit drafts, editors tag them as "Sports" or "Politics" and the content magically appears in the appropriate section of the website, formatted appropriately with custom views and fields.

But Wordpress also was needlessly complicated for my use. For one, it recreates an authoring environment. While it is appealing to think about actually writing in Wordpress, many of us rely on tools that are both more powerful and more familar to a writer. It makes no sense to author blog posts in one environment while writing letters in another and articles in yet another. At some point, I began just copying and pasting from my word editor to post. 

With time, backup became a problem too. Increasingly, academics use Wordpress and similar blogging platforms to host their online portfolios, to aggregate published material, to run course discussion forums, and to share research in progress. With increased range of uses comes increased responsibility. Specifically, I started thinking about backup. The SQL database which houses the actual content sreved by Wordpress needs redandant backup. There are easy "one click" solutions out there, at minimal cost. But I am not a SQL expert. I am not sure what I would do with a corrupt SQL database. And, I already have way to back up everything else on my hard drive. Now, in addition I had to worry archiving multiple websites on multiple servers.

Hosting itself feels redunadnt. I run virtual servers in cloud to work with large archives. Why should I pay host to host my website? But also, I don't really want to become a web-stack sys admin. Fundamentally, my use of blogs and websites is diverse but simple. My personal website contains five categories: thinkstack (misc. posts), publications, courses, projects, and materials. These do not change too much. I needed a platform that is flexible and simple--something that fits with what I already do in managing text and code.

My recent switch to Markdown and plain text has furthe
