Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences Collective

The information age is characterized both by the proliferation of data and the advancement of computer technology. Together these developments have created an unprecedented opportunity to address longstanding questions in the humanities and social sciences, expanding traditional modes of inquiry to large-scale datasets.

The aim of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences Collective is to galvanize a diverse community of students and scholars interested in data curation, knowledge design, big history, complex social systems, experimental criticism, cultural analytics, network analysis, computational modeling, text mining, data visualization, and a host of other related methodologies.

We plan to meet regularly as a reading and making group: to keep abreast of recent developments in the field, to share expertise, to run workshops, hackathons and researchathons, to start and to finish projects. Please join our inaugural meeting at 5pm on Monday, September 24 in the hackspace (room TBA) at Butler library and/or ping dhcss+subscribe@googlegroups.com to join the mailing list.
